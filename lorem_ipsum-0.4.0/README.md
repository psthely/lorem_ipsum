# Full JavaScript Web Page

The components are now declared as Strings. The index.html file only contains
JavaScript to declare variables (ids, classes) and functions, declare each
component individually and render the components on the Web page.

## Individual components

Each component have its own js and css file. The component.js contains the data,
the JavaScript treatments and the HTML structure of the component.

## JavaScript generated index.html

Writing the main JavaScript code into the index.html file is I think more convenient
to understand the flow of execution.
