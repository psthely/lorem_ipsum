# Full JavaScript Web Page

The components are now declared as Strings. The index.html file only contains
JavaScript functions, declare each
component individually and render the components on the Web page.

## Individual components

Each component have its own js and css file. The component.js contains the data,
the JavaScript treatments and the HTML structure of the component.

## JavaScript generated index.html

Writing the main JavaScript code into the index.html file is I think more convenient
to understand the flow of execution.

## Update
A new function `addAttr(name, value)` is declared. This is more convenient to add
any type of attributes and values to the HTML elements.
