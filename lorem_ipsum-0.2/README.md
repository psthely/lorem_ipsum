# Structured Data for the content

The main tag of the HTML file is now empty.

The sections are generated with JavaScript, so you can easily add, update
and remove sections.

# Update HTML layout and CSS

The HTML main header structure was modified to display the subtitle on the
right div.

Some CSS redundant properties was moved to the body selector, the look of the
nav links have changed.

The main logo have now a max-height property to avoid a too large picture.
